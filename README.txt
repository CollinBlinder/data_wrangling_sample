As a professional programmer, I can share none of the code I have produced due to Intellectual Property restrictions. In my capacity doing pro bono work in support of criminal justice reform, I have written code that I have deemed unethical to share due to the sensitivity of the (open source) information being collected. I therefore provide this nondescript assessment I completed to reflect my approach to writing data intensive programs.
